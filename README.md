# Healthcare-Analysis-Tableau-Project
Objective: Developing a Tableau workbook using the Healthcare Dataset (CSV file) which includes the data regarding patients’ blood pressure, BMI, glucose and diabetes for patients from the 20+ age group and creating 2 Dashboards and then a story using the 2 Dashboards and a worksheet.
<br>
Dashboard 1 Requirements:
  Take any image regarding healthcare and drag it to the dashboard.
  Using Text object, give it a meaningful name based on your data analysis of the file.
  <br>
 Dashboard 2 Requirements:
    View 1: Diabetic/Non-diabetic using Shapes
            Use Shapes to show the distribution between diabetic/non-diabetic patients.
            Using the “Outcome” field, write a calculated field by classifying 1 as Diabetic patients and 0 as Non-diabetic patients.
            Show the percent distribution as shown in the expected view.
            Use the color of your choice to differentiate Diabetic Vs. Non-diabetic patients.
            Tooltip should display patient count.
            Format as per your choice.
            Enable Action filters.
    View 2: Patient summary by Blood Pressure category
            Use any shape of your choice to show patient summary by blood pressure category.
            Show the Patient count and BP category type on the labels.
            Use the color of your choice to differentiate Diabetic Vs. Non-diabetic patients.
            Format as per your choice.
            Enable Action filters.
     View 3: Create a Histogram to show Body Mass Index (BMI) by Age Groups.
              Since we need to build a Histogram, using the Age field, let’s create bins using size 5.
              In case, there are missing values, hide them.
              Display the average BMI value on top of each bar and round it to 2 decimals.
              Use the average BMI to color the palette using shades of Red.
    View 4: Single Bar showing percent distribution of patients by BMI type
            Create a calculated field to classify Patients by BMI types.
            'Underweight'
            'Healthy Weight'
            'Overweight'
            'Obese'
            Enable Action filters.  
    View 5: Bar Chart showing Patient break down by Blood Pressure and Diabetes
            Create a calculated field to only highlight Diabetic patients with High and Low blood pressures.          
    View 6: Build a HEAT MAP showing several health factors by Age group

  Story Requirements:
                      Story Name: Healthcare
                      Story Title: Healthcare Summary Report
                      Story size:  Custom Size (best choice)
                      Story Layout: Navigator style should be set to Numbers
                      Story Point 1: Should contain Dashboard 1
                      Story Point 2: Should contain Dashboard 2
                      Story Point 3: Should contain Heat Map Worksheet
    <br>
    Project Requirement:
                      The Workbook should have a Story consisting of several Story points based on the requirement.
                      All worksheets should be hidden.
                      Copy-Paste the screenshots for every view in a word document and upload the document for verification.
